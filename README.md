# RPCRAFT Lab Mod

This is a small mod that I have developed purely to be able to learn more about Fabric modding... 
I wanted to make a custom lab in Minecraft and so decided that this would be a great why of finally developing those Java skills.

Using some other work as a source and an opportunity to learn more...
